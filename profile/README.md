##### what is it ?

​	A bunch of libraries new/rewritten in moonscript.

  ##### Why ?

​	I want to create a framework that will later enable me to create some funky 2D games. But i don't want to blindly use libraries without understanding how they work, so I decided to re-write a handful of [Love2D](https://love2d.org/)  libraries in [Moonscript](https://moonscript.org/) and modify them to be OOP friendly since moon enables the use of classes. 

​	You can read more about this in my blog : https://marodungeon.neocities.org/pages/blogs/b2

##### Target

​	2D will be the main focus since thats what i love to do. 

##### Why Moonscript ?

​	My brain loves it for some reason i really can't explain... plus it compiles into [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) which is the scripting language used by  [Love2D](https://love2d.org/).

##### Should you expect any games soon ?

​	I might do some Jams but the actual game that i want to work on will only start in development after at least 90% of all the needed libs are done.
